<h1>Sentinel<sup>&reg;</sup> LDK and Sentinel HASP<sup>&reg;</sup>
Run-time Environment Command-line Installer: Readme</h1>
<h2>Installer Version 6.60</h2>
<h2>  Package Version 6.60</h2>
<h3>August 2013</h3>
<hr align="left">
<p>This document provides information regarding the Run-time
Environment Command-line Installer for Sentinel HASP and Sentinel LDK,
including enhancements and limitations. Using this installer, you can
test HASP4, Hardlock, Sentinel HL, Sentinel HASP, and Sentinel LDK
under any of the supported operating systems. ("Sentinel LDK" is the
next generation of the Sentinel HASP system.)</p>
<h2>Operating Systems Supported</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit) </li>
  <li>Windows Server 2003 (32-bit and 64-bit) </li>
  <li>Windows Vista (32-bit and 64-bit) </li>
  <li>Windows 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit) </li>
  <li>Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit) </li>
  <li>Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit) </li>
  <li>Windows 2008 R2 </li>
  <li>Windows Server 2012</li>
  <li> Windows XP Embedded standard (x86 only)</li>
  <li>Windows 7 Embedded standard SP1 (x86 only)</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest service packs and security updates must be installed.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: The installer detects the version of the operating system at
run-time, before
installing the relevant drivers. </p>

<h2>What's New in This Release?</h2>
<p>Support has been added for Windows XP Embedded and Window 7 Embedded.</p>
<h2>Changes in Terminology</h2>
<p>Sentinel Admin Control Center user interface and help files
incorporate changes in terminology as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Sentinel HASP product is now referred to as Sentinel LDK.</li>
  <li>SL keys that were created with Sentinel HASP Business Studio now
appear in the user interface as "SL-Legacy" keys.</li>
  <li>References to Sentinel EMS in the help files are also valid for
Sentinel HASP Business Studio. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Type <b><code>haspdinst.exe -?</code></b> for command-line help.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>To use Sentinel EMS to produce Run-time Environment installers in the Sentinel 
    LDK v.6.0 or later environment, overwrite the <code>haspdinst.exe</code> file 
    in <br>
    <b>%SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\SafeNet Sentinel\Sentinel EMS\EMSServer\webapps\ems\haspTools\</b> 
    with the file in this package. (For Win32 systems, go to <b>\Program Files\...</b>)</li>
	<br>
  <br>
  <li>A log file of the installation process is written to <b>aksdrvsetup.log</b> 
    in the Windows directory.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note</b>
<ul>
  <li>By default, Windows Vista (and later) operating systems display a <b>User 
    Account Control</b> message during driver installation. Users must click <b>Continue</b> 
    to continue the installation. Alternatively, users can change the default 
    setting from the Control Panel of their operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When upgrading the Run-time Environment, ensure that it is not
currently being accessed. Although the installation program can
terminate applications that are accessing the Run-time, it cannot
terminate running services. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>If you are running HASP License Manager (HASP4 and HASP HL legacy
License Manager) as a service, you must stop the License Manager before
proceeding with the installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessing Admin Control Center in Internet Explorer Metro Mode</h2>

<p>Under Windows 8, Internet Explorer 10 can be operated in "desktop" style or "Metro" style. When users attempt to access
 Admin Control Center for the local License Manager in the Metro style browser, they get the message "This page can't be displayed". (This problem does not occur when a user attempt to access Admin Control Center for a remote License Manager.)</p>
<p>To access Admin Control Center for the local License Manager under Windows 8 with Internet Explorer 10, the user must do either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operate Internet Explorer in desktop style:
<ol>
<br><li>After you receive the message "This page can't be displayed" in Metro style, click the wrench icon at the bottom right of the browser window.</li>
<br><br><li>Click <b>View on the desktop</b>. Admin Control Center is displayed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<br><li>Enable Internet Explorer to access Admin Control Center in Metro style:
<ol>
<br><li>After you receive the message "This page can't be displayed" in Metro style, click the wrench icon at the bottom right of the browser window.</li>
      <br><br><li>Click <b>View on the desktop</b>. Admin Control Center is displayed.</li>
      <br><br><li>Click the cogwheel ("Tools") icon at the top right of the browser window. 
        From the menu, select <b>Internet options > Security</b>. Select the <b>Trusted 
        sites</b> zone. Click the <b>Sites</b> button.</li>
      <br><br><li>"http://localhost" is already filled in. Click <b>Add</b>. Close the screen.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li> When Control Guard Agent version 4.0.0.27 is present on a computer, installation 
    of the Run-time Environment will cause the operating system to crash. If this 
    occurs, update to a later version of Control Guard Agent. </li><br><br>
  <li> When SkyRecon StormShield Agent version 5.6 is present on a computer, installation 
    of the Run-time Environment will cause the operating system to crash. If this 
    occurs, contact SkyRecon support to determine if a fix is available. </li>
</ul>
